<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>Price and Features Correlation: Generally, higher-priced models (like HydroGrow's AquaBloom X1) offer more features such as higher plant capacity and larger water reservoirs.
  </li>
    <li>Feature Trade-offs: The NatureNest SproutSphere is the most affordable option, but it lacks key features like soil sensors and app connectivity, indicating a trade-off between cost and advanced functionality.
  </li>
    <li>Mid-Range Value: The GreenThumb GrowPro 3000 and BloomTech UrbanGarden V2 are in the mid-price range, and offer a good balance of features. The bloomtech is the lower of the two, and still has app connectivity and soil sensors, so it may be the best value.
